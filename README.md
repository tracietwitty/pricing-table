# Pricing Table - HTML & CSS Practice

## My goals with this activity were to: 
1. Review flexbox methods in a mobile-first design
2. Utilize media queries to trigger layout changes
3. Practice common class naming conventions for ease-of-understanding
4. Only use HTML and CSS
5. Remember how to add an existing folder to a new git repo
